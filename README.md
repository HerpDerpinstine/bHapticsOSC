### VRCHAT AVATAR CREATION:

- Be sure to create a backup of the Avatar's Scene before continuing.

1) Download the Source Code for [Ha√Ø~](https://github.com/hai-vr)'s Animator As Code from [HERE](https://github.com/hai-vr/av3-animator-as-code/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2) Extract the ``av3-animator-as-code-main`` Folder from the ZIP to the Root of your Project's Assets folder.
3) Download the bHapticsOSC VRCSDK Unity Package from [Releases](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/bHapticsOSC/releases).
4) Import the bHapticsOSC VRCSDK Unity Package to your Project.
5) Navigate to ``Assets/bHapticsOSC/VRChat/Prefabs``.

6) Pick a set. Inside the Prefabs folder you will see 2 sets of Prefabs.  
One set is for just the Contacts, One set is for using the included Meshs.  

7) Drag, Position, and Attach the Prefabs from that set's folder onto the Avatar's Armature.
8) Add the ``bHapticsOSC Integration`` component to the Avatar next to it's Avatar Descriptor.

9) Select which Devices you wish to Integrate.  

- Every Device will give you a ``Mesh GameObject`` selection.  
If you used a Device Prefab that has an included Mesh then select it here, if not leave this blank.  

- Some Devices will give you a ``Use ParentConstraints`` option.  
This will attempt to attach ParentConstraints from the Prefab to the Avatar's Bones.  

10) Click the ``APPLY`` button.
